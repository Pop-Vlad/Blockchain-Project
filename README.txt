IDEEA:
Our idea is to create a lottery on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows the users to exchange ETH for game tokens implementing the ERC-20 standard.
The users can use these tokens to take part in the lottery. A user can use 1 token for a chance to win and has a fixed probability of winning.
The winner is decided based on a random number. When a user loses they receive nothing and their token is added to the prize pool.
When a user wins they receive a fixed percentage of the prize pool. The rest is kept in the prize pool to avoid the value of the prize pool being too small.
A user can exchange the tokens back for Eth, but with a fee. The owner can extract the accumulated fee by the contract.
When the game starts or if the prize pool is too small, the owner can add tokens to the prize pool to incentivize users to play the game.
